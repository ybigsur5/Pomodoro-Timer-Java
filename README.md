# Pomodoro-Timer-Java
A Pomodoro timer with changing colours for each sessions. It is designed for 25 minutes in 4 sessions.

The code itself is simplistic, as it is intentionally coded for a coding assignment. I might make it more interractive when I get more time and add more features like adding music playlist and other plugins. 

I am open for feedbacks!
